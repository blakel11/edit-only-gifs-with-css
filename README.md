# GIF CSS

I was unable to find a way to only target GIFs with CSS for my site www.giftutors.com. 

I wanted a way to use CSS on my GIFs without having to manually add a class to each image.


##jQuery to the Rescue
I use jQuery to iterate through each image and add a class of gif to it if the last 3 letters of the src is "gif".
