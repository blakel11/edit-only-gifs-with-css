# GIF CSS

I was unable to find a way to only target GIFs with CSS for my site www.giftutors.com. 
I wanted a way to use CSS on my GIFs without having to manually add a class to each image.


##jQuery to the Rescue
I used jQuery to iterate through each image and add a class of gif to it if the last 3 letters of the src was "gif".

##Run Plugin
All you need to do is run this plugin with your code and all GIF files will has a class of "GIF"
